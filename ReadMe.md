## Customization

### Modifying Game Data

- The game data is defined in the `scripts.js` file within the `gameData` object.
- It includes three rounds: `single`, `double`, and `final`.

#### Example Structure

```javascript
const gameData = {
    "Board Name": {
        "single": [
            {
                "category": "Category 1",
                "clues": [
                    {
                        "value": 200,
                        "clue": "This is a sample clue.",
                        "solution": "What is the sample solution?"
                    },
                    // ... more clues
                ]
            },
            // ... more categories
        ],
        "double": [
            // ... Similar structure as "single" with different values
        ],
        "final": {
            "category": "Final Category",
            "clue": "This is the Final Jeopardy clue.",
            "solution": "What is the solution to the Final Jeopardy clue?"
        }
    },
    // ... more boards
};
```

- **To Customize:**
  - Update the `category` names.
  - Modify the `clue` and `solution` texts.
  - Adjust the `value` amounts as desired.
  - Mark any clue as a Daily Double by adding `"dailyDouble": true` to the clue object.

### Adding More Soundboard Buttons

- In `index.html`, add more buttons within the `<div id="soundboard">` section.
- In `scripts.js`, add event listeners for the new buttons.
- Include the corresponding audio files and update the HTML to reference them.

## Files Included

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the game.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file containing styles for the game.
- `scripts.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.
- `ReadMe.md`: This documentation file.

## Dependencies

- No external libraries or frameworks are required.

## Known Issues

- **Wagering in Final Jeopardy**: Wagering functionality is not implemented. You may need to extend the code to handle wagers.
- **Negative Scores**: Players' scores can go negative. If you wish to prevent this, add a condition in the `adjustPlayerScore` function.
- **Audio Playback Overlaps**: Rapid clicking may cause audio overlaps. The code resets the audio playback position to mitigate this.
