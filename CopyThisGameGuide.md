## Step 2: Fork the Repository

Now, youâ€™ll make a copy of the Jeopardy game code so you can customize it.

1. Go to the repository that hosts the Jeopardy game https://github.com/miamimanni/jeopardy2
2. Once youâ€™re on the main page of the repository, look for the **Fork** button in the upper-right corner (itâ€™s near the Star and Watch buttons).
3. Click **Fork** to create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
4. After a few moments, youâ€™ll see a new copy of the repository under **your** account. This is now **your** version to edit and modify as you like!

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

Youâ€™re going to publish your version of the game to GitHub Pages, which is a free service that hosts your website.

1. On your newly forked repository, click the **Settings** tab.
2. Scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** section.
3. In the dropdown under **Source**, select **main branch**.
4. Once selected, GitHub Pages will automatically publish your website from the `index.html` file in the repository.
5. Youâ€™ll get a green notification saying your site is published! The link to your live website will appear hereâ€”save this link for later!

## Step 4: Create a GitHub CodeSpace

GitHub CodeSpaces gives you an environment to edit your code directly within your browser.

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **Code** button (the green one), and choose **CodeSpaces**.
3. Click **Create CodeSpace**. This will open a development environment in your browser.
4. Inside CodeSpace, youâ€™ll see the files of your repository on the left and the code editor in the center.

### Recommended Extensions

While youâ€™re in CodeSpace, installing these extensions will make your work easier:
- **Prettier - Code Formatter**: Helps format your code.

To install these extensions:
1. Click the **Extensions** icon on the left sidebar in CodeSpace.
2. Search for the extensions by name and click **Install**.

## Step 5: Modify the Game Data

Now that youâ€™re in the code, letâ€™s modify the game itself!

1. In the file list on the left, find and click on the `script.js` file. This file contains the main logic for the game.
2. Look for this section of code inside the `script.js` file:

```javascript
const gameData = {
    "Board Name": {
        "single": [
            {
                "category": "Category 1",
                "clues": [
                    {
                        "value": 200,
                        "clue": "This is a sample clue.",
                        "solution": "What is the sample solution?"
                    },
                    // ... more clues
                ]
            },
            // ... more categories
        ],
        "double": [
            // ... Similar structure as "single" with different values
        ],
        "final": {
            "category": "Final Category",
            "clue": "This is the Final Jeopardy clue.",
            "solution": "What is the solution to the Final Jeopardy clue?"
        }
    },
    // ... more boards
};
```


3. To customize the game, change the `"category"`, `"clue"`, `"solution"`, and `"value"` fields as you wish! For example:
   - Change `"Category 1"` to something else like `"Science"`.
   - Modify the clue to be a question of your choice.
   - Update the solution with the correct answer.
4. You can add or remove categories and clues by following the same structure you see in the example.

Note you can use this [sample game](https://github.com/miamimanni/jeopardy2/blob/main/sample_game.json) as a guide

## Step 6: Save Your Changes and Commit

Once youâ€™ve made the changes to your game, you need to save and push them to GitHub.

1. In CodeSpace, click **File** > **Save** to save the changes youâ€™ve made to the `script.js` file.
2. Now, letâ€™s commit your changes:
   1. On the left sidebar, click the **Source Control** icon (it looks like a branch).
   2. You should see your modified `script.js` file listed. Click the **+** button next to the file to stage it.
   3. In the text box above, write a short message about your changes, like `Updated game data`.
   4. Click the checkmark icon to commit the changes.

2. Click the **Actions** tab at the top.
3. Here, youâ€™ll see the progress of your website being rebuilt.
